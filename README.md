TradeMe-looking resume website

I created this website roughly in July 2014 in couple of days as a preparation for job seek. Originally hosted on bitbucket I now moved it to github after quickly tidying up the code. It's still quite ugly though.

Built using Node.js, AngularJS, bootstrap, less, gulp, browserify and powered by data stored in dropbox as json and markdown.
